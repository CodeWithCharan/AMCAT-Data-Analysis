# AMCAT Data Analysis

## Objectives
The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) that includes both univariate and bivariate analyses. This analysis aims to:
- Understand the distribution of individual variables (univariate analysis).
- Identify outliers within the dataset.
- Explore relationships between different variables (bivariate analysis) to uncover insights related to salary expectations.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of information about individuals, their educational background, job details, and personality traits. It contains 38 columns and 3998 data points. They are independent variables, both continuous and categorical in nature.
